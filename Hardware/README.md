# ProVeg Sensor Node Hardware

The PCB allows the connection of a cheap NodeMCU v3 as WiFi-enabled microcontroller with (all optional):

* A 128 x 160 LCD screen
* A buzzer with an NPN transistor like the 2N2222 and a resistor of about 2k to drive it
* A BME280 temperature, humidity and pressure sensor module (to calibrate the CCS811 measurements)
* A CCS811 CO2e sensor
